AI Engineer Programming Test: Agentic AI 
Objective:
Assess the candidate's ability to design and implement a simple agentic AI system using multi-agent orchestration, incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
Framework Options:
Candidates can choose one of the following free and simple frameworks:
1.	Langchain/Langgraph
2.	OpenAI Agents SDK 
Tools & Requirements:
•	Data Handling: Standard Python libraries and a simple local file (e.g., a .txt file) to simulate a knowledge base.
•	LLM: The candidate can use any LLM available in the market (Or please send an email to kanit.mekritthikrai@bangkokbank.com to grant the access to the following gpt-5-mini
endpoint = "https://oaibblinnocandiddate01.openai.azure.com/"
model_name = "gpt-5-mini"
deployment = "gpt-5-mini"
subscription_key = "<contact>"
•	Required Skills: Python programming, basic understanding of RAG, API interaction, and prompt design. 
Scenario:
Build a system with two agents:
1.	"Data Retriever" Agent (RAG): Specializes in retrieving specific information from a provided knowledge base (a simple text file). It does not answer questions directly but provides relevant text snippets.
2.	"Report Generator" Agent: Receives the snippets from the Data Retriever and synthesizes them into a cohesive, non-redundant, and well-formatted answer to a user's query.
Task Instructions:
Create a text file named knowledge_base.txt containing a few paragraphs of sample information (e.g., company policies, product descriptions, or general facts about a topic like "cats").
Agent Definitions:
-	Data Retriever:
o	Role/Instructions: Expert in information retrieval. Searches the knowledge_base.txt file  for all snippets relevant to the user's request.
o	Tool: Implement a custom Python function/tool that reads the knowledge_base.txt file and performs a simple keyword or basic semantic search. The agent should be configured to use this tool.
o	Output: Return raw, relevant text chunks to the Report Generator.
-	Report Generator:
o	Role/Instructions: Expert writer and synthesizer. Uses the provided information snippets to formulate a comprehensive, high-quality answer for the end-user.
o	Tool: No additional tools needed.
o	Output: The final, polished answer presented to the user.
Task Orchestration:
-	Orchestrate a sequential workflow where the Data Retriever's output is passed as input to the Report Generator.
-	Candidates using the OpenAI Agents SDK/Langchain should use either a "handoff" pattern or an "agent-as-tool" pattern or any other pattern to coordinate the two agents. 
Execution and Evaluation:
-	Run the system with a sample query (e.g., "What is the policy on international travel?").
-	The candidate should submit the complete Python code, the knowledge_base.txt file, and a screenshot of the final output for a few different queries on the github repository. 
-	Evaluation Criteria:
•	Correct use of the chosen framework to define agents and orchestrate the workflow.
•	Effective implementation of the RAG mechanism (the custom data retrieval tool).
•	Clarity and quality of the final output (non-redundant, accurate based on provided info, well-formatted).
•	Code structure, readability, and adherence to Python best practices.
